# CSCI1030U Graphics Examples

These are the examples for 3D graphics, given by guest lecturer Randy J. Fortier, for CSCI 1030U in Fall 2018.

## Lecture 01 - Geometry Generation, Modelling, and Transformations

- Graphics01a_Parametrics_Sphere - An OpenGL program in C++ that generates and displays a sphere with arbitrary resolution
- Graphics01b_Parametrics_Bezier - A series JavaScript programs that generate various cubic curves
- Graphics01c_Parametrics_BezierSurfaces - An OpenGL program in C++ that generates and displays a teapot by generating its geometry with bezier surfaces

## Lecture 02 - Shading, Texture Mapping, and Ray Tracing

- Graphics02a_Shading_Interpolation - A JavaScript program that interpolates colours across the surface of a triangle using barycentric coordinates
- Graphics02b_Shading_Phong - An OpenGL program in C++ that displays an object using Gouraud and Phong shading
- Graphics02c_TextureMapping_Basic - An OpenGL program in C++ that displays an object using texture mapping
- Graphics02d_TextureMapping_SkyBox_QuaternionTrackball - An OpenGL program in C++ that displays an object with reflection/refraction mapping in a sky box
- Graphics02e_TextureMapping_Procedural - An OpenGL program in C++ that displays an object with procedurally-generated textures and/or bump mapping
- Graphics02f_RayTracing - A C++ program that uses ray tracing to draw a scene consisting of spheres with various materials
